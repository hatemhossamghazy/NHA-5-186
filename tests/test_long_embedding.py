"""Tests for sliding-window splitting and the long-function embedding pipeline.

The pipeline tests use a fake embedder, so CodeBERT itself is never loaded.
The windowing tests need the CodeBERT *tokenizer* (a small download, cached after the
first run). If it cannot be loaded, these tests are skipped instead of failing.
